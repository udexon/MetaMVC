♣  Food Money Knowledge Bank 财食智库 (FMKB): Buy Cooked Food or Invest $10 A Day, AND Change the World.

- Buy cooked food at $10 a day (in any local currency) or use it as microloan funds.
- Train unemployed, homeless, poor as cooks.
- Deliver cooked food from home to home.

Food Money Knowledge Bank is an charity-cum-business amphibious venture, aimed at helping the most disadvantaged people in the society, providing them with not just food, but knowledge and investment to help them become truly independent business owners.

From the customer and investor perspectives, they can 
spend as little as $10 a day (or any equivalent local currency, based on Malaysian Ringgit MYR) on cooked food prepared by FMKB trainers and trainees, or 
invest in their operations i.e. pay a day ahead or a few days ahead, and get back returns in cash or kind, in an invest-reward cycle that can be as short as a few hours to a few days.

As such, FMBK is a unique and significant project that encompasses  IT as well as non-IT participants, from programmers to housewives, job seekers, investors, start-up entrepreneurs, students, senior citizens, etc.

Unlike other start-up ventures, FMKB is a unique, instant ROI (return of investment), self-sustaining start-up venture:

Instant ROI: Investors (lenders) may invest as little as MYR10 (or equivalent local currency) to cooks (and trainees) and get back 20% on the next day.

Self sustaining: Profits earned by cooks and investors can be used to fund programmers to develop a Decentralized Social Media app for Food Money Knowledge Bank — see … for 


In short, Food Money Knowledge Bank is like Uber and Grab, except that the delivery riders can now earn MORE and OWN part of FMKB business, instead of  risking their lives everyday on the roads, just for some paltry minimum wages.
